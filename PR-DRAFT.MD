### Draft PR Message: Move to Percentage-Based JVM Settings

**Title:** Migrate to Percentage-Based JVM Settings for Java Images Using Chainguard Runner Images

**Summary:**
This PR proposes migrating to percentage-based JVM settings for our Java images while continuing to use Chainguard runner images. This approach allows for more dynamic and resource-efficient memory management in our containerized Java applications.

**Background:**
Currently, our JVM settings are fixed, which can lead to suboptimal resource utilization in varying environments. By adopting percentage-based JVM settings, we can ensure that our applications dynamically adjust their memory usage based on the available resources, improving overall performance and efficiency.

**Changes Made:**
1. **JVM Settings Update:**
   - Updated JVM options to use percentage-based settings:
     - `-XX:InitialRAMPercentage=50`
     - `-XX:MinRAMPercentage=50`
     - `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=80`
   - These settings ensure that our Java applications use 50% of available memory at startup, with a minimum of 50% and a maximum of 80% of the available memory throughout their lifecycle.

2. **Continued Use of Chainguard Runner Images:**
   - We continue to use Chainguard runner images for our Java applications due to their enhanced security and suitability for production environments.

**Testing and Verification:**
- Multiple tests were conducted to ensure compatibility and performance with the new settings.
- Attempted to parameterize JVM options using environment variables, but this was not feasible due to Chainguard images lacking shells necessary for expanding variables in the entrypoint.
- Also experimented with using shell scripts but encountered similar issues.
- Static setting of JVM options in the Dockerfile proved to be effective and reliable.

**Additional Notes:**
- **HR-Mandated Training Completion:**
  - Completed 8 HR-mandated training modules.
- **Future Work:**
  - Continue to explore potential workarounds for parameterizing JVM options within Chainguard images.
  - Further testing to identify any edge cases or performance issues.

**Review and Feedback:**
- Please review the changes and provide feedback.
- Any suggestions for improvement or concerns regarding this approach are welcome.

### Implementation Example:

```Dockerfile
FROM chainguard:latest

# Set JVM options using static values as environment variable expansion in ENTRYPOINT is not supported
ENV JVM_OPTS="-XX:InitialRAMPercentage=50 -XX:MinRAMPercentage=50 -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=80"

CMD ["java", "-XX:InitialRAMPercentage=50", "-XX:MinRAMPercentage=50", "-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=80", "-jar", "/path/to/your/application.jar"]
```

By adopting these changes, we aim to enhance the resource efficiency and performance of our Java applications. Thank you for reviewing this proposal.

### Status Report for Slack

**Project:** Linkerd Service Mesh Implementation  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Prepared by:** [Your Name]

#### Executive Summary

We have made significant progress on our implementation direction for the Linkerd service mesh across our Kubernetes environments. Here are the key activities and achievements so far:

#### Key Achievements

- **Proof of Concept (PoC) with Docker Hub:**
  - Developed and tested PoC for deploying a simple Node.js application (HelloWorld) using Docker Hub.
  - Created two deployments, `helloworld1` and `helloworld2`, in a dedicated namespace.
  - Implemented environment variable substitution for image registry, image name, tag, and service account name using `envsubst`.

- **Scripting:**
  - Created `setup_dockerhub.sh` for setting up Docker Hub credentials in Kubernetes.
  - Developed `cleanup_dockerhub.sh` to remove Docker Hub credentials.
  - Updated the `Makefile` to include build, push, deploy, and clean targets.
  - Added flexibility for deployment-specific commands and included a check for namespace existence.

- **Comprehensive Documentation:**
  - Detailed the benefits of using namespace annotations for Linkerd deployment, emphasizing simplified deployment processes, enhanced security, improved visibility, and operational efficiency.
  - Highlighted the integration with the internal deployment tool (Fleet), ensuring seamless workflows and mitigating the effect of tribal knowledge.
  - Provided implementation examples and explained the special handling required for cluster shared services.

#### Next Steps

- Continue integrating Linkerd across additional namespaces and applications.
- Collaborate with development teams to ensure smooth adoption and address any issues.
- Finalize the strategy for securing cluster shared services with mTLS.
- We have a working session on Friday with UDP2 US Dev to further discuss and demonstrate the implementation.
- Automate namespace annotations with a script and plan to dockerize the automation script later.

I will be creating a PR to merge these changes and will be ready to demo the implementation soon. Additionally, I intentionally created a basic demo on my laptop for testing purposes since I encountered issues pulling images from the main artifact registry.
