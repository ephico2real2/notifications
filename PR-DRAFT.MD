### Draft PR Message: Move to Percentage-Based JVM Settings

**Title:** Migrate to Percentage-Based JVM Settings for Java Images Using Chainguard Runner Images

**Summary:**
This PR proposes migrating to percentage-based JVM settings for our Java images while continuing to use Chainguard runner images. This approach allows for more dynamic and resource-efficient memory management in our containerized Java applications.

**Background:**
Currently, our JVM settings are fixed, which can lead to suboptimal resource utilization in varying environments. By adopting percentage-based JVM settings, we can ensure that our applications dynamically adjust their memory usage based on the available resources, improving overall performance and efficiency.

**Changes Made:**
1. **JVM Settings Update:**
   - Updated JVM options to use percentage-based settings:
     - `-XX:InitialRAMPercentage=50`
     - `-XX:MinRAMPercentage=50`
     - `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=80`
   - These settings ensure that our Java applications use 50% of available memory at startup, with a minimum of 50% and a maximum of 80% of the available memory throughout their lifecycle.

2. **Continued Use of Chainguard Runner Images:**
   - We continue to use Chainguard runner images for our Java applications due to their enhanced security and suitability for production environments.

**Testing and Verification:**
- Multiple tests were conducted to ensure compatibility and performance with the new settings.
- Attempted to parameterize JVM options using environment variables, but this was not feasible due to Chainguard images lacking shells necessary for expanding variables in the entrypoint.
- Also experimented with using shell scripts but encountered similar issues.
- Static setting of JVM options in the Dockerfile proved to be effective and reliable.

**Additional Notes:**
- **HR-Mandated Training Completion:**
  - Completed 8 HR-mandated training modules.
- **Future Work:**
  - Continue to explore potential workarounds for parameterizing JVM options within Chainguard images.
  - Further testing to identify any edge cases or performance issues.

**Review and Feedback:**
- Please review the changes and provide feedback.
- Any suggestions for improvement or concerns regarding this approach are welcome.

### Implementation Example:

```Dockerfile
FROM chainguard:latest

# Set JVM options using static values as environment variable expansion in ENTRYPOINT is not supported
ENV JVM_OPTS="-XX:InitialRAMPercentage=50 -XX:MinRAMPercentage=50 -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=80"

CMD ["java", "-XX:InitialRAMPercentage=50", "-XX:MinRAMPercentage=50", "-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=80", "-jar", "/path/to/your/application.jar"]
```

By adopting these changes, we aim to enhance the resource efficiency and performance of our Java applications. Thank you for reviewing this proposal.

### Status Report for Slack

**Project:** Linkerd Service Mesh Implementation  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Prepared by:** [Your Name]

#### Executive Summary

We have made significant progress on our implementation direction for the Linkerd service mesh across our Kubernetes environments. Here are the key activities and achievements so far:

#### Key Achievements

- **Proof of Concept (PoC) with Docker Hub:**
  - Developed and tested PoC for deploying a simple Node.js application (HelloWorld) using Docker Hub.
  - Created two deployments, `helloworld1` and `helloworld2`, in a dedicated namespace.
  - Implemented environment variable substitution for image registry, image name, tag, and service account name using `envsubst`.

- **Scripting:**
  - Created `setup_dockerhub.sh` for setting up Docker Hub credentials in Kubernetes.
  - Developed `cleanup_dockerhub.sh` to remove Docker Hub credentials.
  - Updated the `Makefile` to include build, push, deploy, and clean targets.
  - Added flexibility for deployment-specific commands and included a check for namespace existence.

- **Comprehensive Documentation:**
  - Detailed the benefits of using namespace annotations for Linkerd deployment, emphasizing simplified deployment processes, enhanced security, improved visibility, and operational efficiency.
  - Highlighted the integration with the internal deployment tool (Fleet), ensuring seamless workflows and mitigating the effect of tribal knowledge.
  - Provided implementation examples and explained the special handling required for cluster shared services.

#### Next Steps

- Continue integrating Linkerd across additional namespaces and applications.
- Collaborate with development teams to ensure smooth adoption and address any issues.
- Finalize the strategy for securing cluster shared services with mTLS.
- We have a working session on Friday with UDP2 US Dev to further discuss and demonstrate the implementation.
- Automate namespace annotations with a script and plan to dockerize the automation script later.

I will be creating a PR to merge these changes and will be ready to demo the implementation soon. Additionally, I intentionally created a basic demo on my laptop for testing purposes since I encountered issues pulling images from the main artifact registry.

### Status Report for Slack


#### Executive Summary

Considerable progress has been made in automating the annotation of namespaces for Linkerd service mesh integration. The scripting efforts focused on enhancing the automation process and ensuring flexibility for various use cases. The scripts are now ready for testing.

#### Key Achievements

- **Development of Annotation Automation Script:**
  - Created a bash script (`linkerd_namespace_annotator.sh`) to automate the annotation of namespaces for Linkerd injection.
  - Added support for both command-line arguments and YAML configuration file input to specify namespaces and their respective annotation states.
  - Implemented a check to avoid redundant annotations by verifying if the namespace already has the desired annotation.

- **Script Features:**
  - Ability to annotate multiple namespaces in a single run using CLI options.
  - Included options for dry run and verbose output to simulate changes and provide detailed execution logs.
  - Ensured compatibility with common CLI tools (`kubectl` and `yq`) and validated their presence before execution.
  - Enhanced error handling to log issues and continue processing remaining namespaces.

- **Documentation and Examples:**
  - Provided usage examples for both CLI and YAML file inputs.
  - Documented the script functionalities and options clearly for ease of use.

#### Next Steps

- **Testing:**
  - The scripts require thorough testing to ensure they work as expected in various scenarios.
  - Testing will include verifying the correct annotation of namespaces, handling of edge cases, and validation of dry run and verbose modes.

- **Feedback and Iteration:**
  - Gather feedback from initial testing and refine the scripts based on the findings.
  - Ensure robustness and reliability before integrating the scripts into the deployment workflow.

I will be creating a PR to merge these changes and will be ready to demo the implementation soon. Additionally, a basic demo was created on my laptop for testing purposes since I encountered issues pulling images from the main artifact registry.
